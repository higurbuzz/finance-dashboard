# Finance Dashboard

This project is a finance dashboard built during my internship at INNOVA. The dashboard is designed to help users manage and track their financial activities.

In order to use React in more detail and produce different components, I focused on the dashboard, transactions, and credit card pages. 

## Features

- **Dashboard Overview:** A comprehensive overview of all financial activities.
- **Transactions:** Track your financial transactions.
- **Credit Cards:** View your credit cards and add new cards.
- **Dark/Light Theme:** Switch between light, dark, and auto (system) themes.
- **Multilingual Support:** Switch between English and Turkish.
- **Responsive Design:** Support mobile, tablet and desktop.

## Tech Stack
  - React.js
  - React Router
  - React i18next for localization
  - Rechars
  - CSS for styling
  - JSON server (for demonstration purposes)

## Getting Started
